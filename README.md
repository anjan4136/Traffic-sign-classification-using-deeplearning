# Traffic-sign-classification-using-deeplearning
step1: Download the data set from the kaggle into your local computer.
step2: Upload this into your drive so that it can be accessed from colab.
step3: Mount the drive to google colab.
step4: You see all the files in your drive.
step5: Unzip the dataset in colab using !unzip and give the path.
step6: This may be tricky create training folder in your workspace 
step7: Add data.npy, target.npy
step8: Some images in the main code will not be shown as i added it during the run time.
step9: You can neglect those as they are just for understanding and the prototype does not actually resemble the original.

#Majority of the code is incorporated from https://github.com/Spidy20/Traffic_Signs_WebApp
#They have done this using juypter noteboooks while i have explicitly used only colab.
